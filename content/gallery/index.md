I'm an illustrator and designer, with a flair for fantastical and historical subjects and a penchant for playing with style. In 2018 I completed my master’s in Animation, with a focus on visual development and background painting. I’ve been a freelance artist since 2019, creating work for board games, TTRPGs, packaging for wines and spirits, and more.
