### FAQ

**Will my pens bleed through?**
Our 160gsm paper will stand up to most pens, although alcohol-based inks and especially heavy markers may show through. We always recommend a pen test, and have included space for this at the start of your journal!

**Can I paint in this journal?**
Yes, absolutely! If you want to use watercolours we recommend clamping or taping your page to a hard surface to prevent wrinkling as it dries.

**Are the pages numbered?**
Yes, and we’ve provided a handy index so you can put those numbers to good use.

**How many pages are there?**
200, enough for a year of spreads if you like a minimalist journal.

**Will it stand up to travel?**
The vegan leather cover is designed to keep your pages safe, and the construction of our journals is engineered to be as robust as possible. It won’t survive being thrown in the pool, but it’ll handle being taken in and out of your bag!

**Do you accept returns?**
We want you to love our notebooks as much as we do - if for any reason you’re unhappy with yours, we’ll replace it or provide a full refund. Just follow the instructions on the delivery note to send it back for free.

**Is the packaging plastic-free?**
Of course!

**Are the materials ethically sourced?**
Yes. We do everything we can to make sure that our journals are gentle on both our planet and the people who live on it.
