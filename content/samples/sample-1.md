BLOG POST - SPECULATIVE SAMPLE

So you’ve chosen your UK summer walking destination, everything’s booked, and all that’s left to do is pack! And that’s when the dread hits you. What if you forget something? What if you can’t fit everything in? What if you get halfway up a mountain and realise you did need the kitchen sink after all?

Never fear, by the power of this checklist you can pack exactly what you need, without your rucksack bursting at the seams!

### 1. Something to carry things in
Assuming your plan is to go on day walks from a home base (stay tuned for a post on backpacking!) you’re going to need a day bag. This should be a 20-30 litre backpack, ideally with a waist strap. I like to add a waterproof cover and liners, but a big plastic bag inside the rucksack will do the trick.

### 2. Comfortable clothing
Not jeans! You want clothes that let you move freely and will dry quickly. Ideally get yourself some light walking trousers and a smart wool top, but sports leggings and a wicking t-shirt will work. Take a fleece as an extra layer.

### 3. Good footwear. Seriously.
Ok, this is the number one most important thing on this list. If you only make one purchase in advance of your trip, make it this one. Your feet carry you, if they get rubbed and wet and miserable, guess what - you’ll also be miserable! Get yourself some good walking socks and one of these options:

- Trainers with grippy tread. These won’t be waterproof, but they’ll be better than street shoes.
- Walking shoes. They don’t need to break the bank, as long as they’re comfortable and waterproof.
- Walking boots. If you’re worried about ankle support, these are your best choice.

### 4. Waterproofs
It’s a summer holiday… but this is the UK. Waterproof jacket AND trousers. Getting wet is the fastest way to get cold, and that’s a good way to end up in difficulties. So pack that mac!

### 5. Water bottle
Make sure it’s at least 500ml, preferably a full litre. Summer walking is sweaty work, and you need to hydrate!

### 6. Accessories
A sunhat, sunglasses if you use them, and possibly a light neck scarf. Suncream is a must. A head torch is a nice addition. I like to take gloves and a woolly hat with me, just in case. And speaking of just in case…

### 7. First aid kit
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. You can buy pre-made kits, but at minimum take a few plasters, antiseptic wipes and some tweezers. A pack of tissues never goes amiss either! And make sure you know how to contact the local rescue services should the need arise.

### 8. Maps!
You need to know where you’re going!

And there you are, you’ve successfully packed everything you need for a comfortable, safe walking holiday in the UK. Have fun, enjoy the countryside, and remember - take only photos, leave only footprints!
