**Hello John!**

I hope your summer’s been fun, and that you’re surviving the chaos of back-to-school season.

We know this can be a stressful time, so we’ve put together a treat for you and your little one - that doesn’t involve yet another car trip!

**Ballerina Bambinos - Online**
- Weekly online ballet classes for ages 2-5.
- Teacher: Jane Smith
- Starting: 15th September
- Time: Every Tuesday, 5pm
- Platform: Zoom
- Sign-ups are open - simply reply to this email to pre-register.

As a mother of two, Jane Smith understands how to keep toddlers engaged and excited. Her classes will make your child feel like a Disney princess (or prince!) while getting them active, learning, and building confidence.

You don’t need any special equipment to join in, just a device that can run Zoom and enough space for your little one to dance around in. We ask that you stay nearby, but we won’t mind if you make dinner at the same time!

Places are limited, so reply now to secure your child’s spot!
