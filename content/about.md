**In a Nutshell:** 
I’m a freelance artist and writer, with a love of history and the great outdoors.

**Art:**
My master’s was in Animation (specifically visual development and background painting) from the University of the West of England. I’ve been a freelance illustrator since 2019. My previous clients include Chaosium and Iron Crown, and I created the artwork for [this ultra-dimensional TTRPG adventure](https://mottokrosh.com/machinations/capes-and-cloaks/), as well as for [this Viking-themed version of the card game Werewolf](https://www.spilbræt.dk/spil/varulv/) among other projects.

**Writing:**
I studied Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at the University of Cambridge, which was an incredible three-year lesson in how to write at speed about subjects I’d never encountered before. 

Once I left university I completed a Content and Marketing Internship for an online education platform. I wrote and proofread marketing copy as well as content for the programme. 

I then spent a couple of years in academic publishing, which allowed me to dip my toes into copywriting for Archaeology, Museums and Heritage.
